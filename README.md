# Welcome
I admit it. I'm not a fan of typed JavaScript...at all. However...TypeScript is beginning to grow on me, and after encountering some growing pains I figured it was time to create a simple starting point that others can share.

This project is a demo based on the guide at [https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) - with the following additional goals in mind:
  + Added the ability to work with Redux DevTools right out of the box
  + Clean organization and minor rewrite of original code
  + Ability to work with React, Redux, and TypeScript **IMMEDIATELY**
    - Sure. You could go through the guide at [https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) - which I strongly encourage anyone to do - but this is a great way to get you off and coding right now.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Feel free to consult their project for some really useful tidbits and guides.

## Getting started
Once you have cloned this repo, simply run:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

That's it. Your application will be running in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. If you make any minor edits to your source code, it will automatically reload.

If you are familiar with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), the usual `npm test`, `npm run build`, and ability to eject the app are available, as well.
